🍎 Apple Quality Classification

Built an MLP model to classify apples as Good or Bad using features like size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity.

What I did:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset

Trained an MLP with three hidden layers

Evaluated performance using F1-score and confusion matrix

Visualized training loss and feature importance with SHAP
